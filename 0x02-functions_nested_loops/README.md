# Project 0x02 - C - Functions, Nested Loops

## Overview

This project ensures learning of the functions concept since C is a procedural language.

## Resources
- [Nested while loops](#)
- [C - Functions](#)
- [Learning to Program in C (Part 06) (stop at 14:00)](#)
- [What is the purpose of a function prototype?](#)
- [C - Header Files (stop before the “Once-Only Headers” paragraph)](#)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without using Google:
- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how to use functions
- The difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- Scope of variables
- The purpose of gcc flags: -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
- What are header files and how to use them with #include

## Requirements
### General
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- **File Endings:** All files should end with a new line
- **README.md:** A mandatory file at the root of the project folder
- **Coding Style:** Use the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- **Global Variables:** Not allowed
- **Functions per File:** No more than 5 functions per file
- **Standard Library:** Not allowed, except for _putchar
- **_putchar.c:** Don't push it; it will be provided
- **main.c:** You can use provided examples for testing, but don't push them
- **Header File:** Include prototypes of all functions and _putchar in a header file called main.h
- **Copyright - Plagiarism:** Strictly forbidden; any form will result in removal from the program

## Additional Info
- You don't have to understand call by reference, stack, static variables, recursions, or arrays yet.

**Note:** Adapt the links in the Resources section to the actual sources you used.
