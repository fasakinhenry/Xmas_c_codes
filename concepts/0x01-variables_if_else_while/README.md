# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Description

This repository contains solutions to tasks focused on the fundamental concepts in C programming, including variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops. Each task is designed to help you understand and practice different aspects of C programming.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain proficiency with arithmetic operators, logical operators, and relational operators.
- Understand the usage of if and if...else statements.
- Learn how to use while loops.
- Familiarize yourself with data types such as char, int, and unsigned int.
- Explore ASCII character set and related concepts.

## Files
