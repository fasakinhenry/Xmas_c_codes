## Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. The goal is to complete the source code to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive, negative, or zero.

#### Instructions

- Complete the [Source Code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c)
- The variable `n` will store a different value every time you run this program.
- You don't have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not modify this code.
- The output of the program should be:
  - The number, followed by
  - If the number is greater than 0: is positive
  - If the number is 0: is zero
  - If the number is less than 0: is negative
  - Followed by a new line

#### Example

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-positive_or_negative.c -o 0-positive_or_negative
$ ./0-positive_or_negative
-520693284 is negative
$ ./0-positive_or_negative
561319348 is positive
$ ./0-positive_or_negative
0 is zero
```

### 1. The Last Digit

This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. The task is to complete the source code to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.

- Complete the [Source Code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c)
- The variable `n` will store a different value every time you run this program.
- You don't have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not modify this code.
- The output of the program should be:
  - The string "Last digit of," followed by
  - `n`, followed by
  - The string "is," followed by
  - If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string "and is greater than 5"
  - If the last digit of `n` is 0: the string "and is 0"
  - If the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string "and is less than 6 and not 0"
  - Followed by a new line

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 1-last_digit.c -o 1-last_digit
$ ./1-last_digit
Last digit of 629438752 is 2 and is less than 6 and not 0
$ ./1-last_digit
Last digit of -748255693 is -3 and is less than 6 and not 0
$ ./1-last_digit
Last digit of 954249937 is 7 and is greater than 5
$ ./1-last_digit
Last digit of 809065140 is 0 and is 0
```


### 2. The Alphabet Game

#### Description

- You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function like `printf`, `puts`, etc., is forbidden).
- The output of the program should be the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

#### Example

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 2-print_alphabet.c -o 2-print_alphabet
$ ./2-print_alphabet
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

- You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function like `printf`, `puts`, etc., is forbidden).
- The output of the program should be the lowercase alphabet, followed by the uppercase alphabet, and a new line.

#### Example

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 3-print_alphabets.c -o 3-print_alphabets
