# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Description

This repository contains solutions to tasks focused on the fundamental concepts in C programming, including variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops. Each task is designed to help you understand and practice different aspects of C programming.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain proficiency with arithmetic operators, logical operators, and relational operators.
- Understand the usage of if and if...else statements.
- Learn how to use while loops.
- Familiarize yourself with data types such as char, int, and unsigned int.
- Explore ASCII character set and related concepts.

## Requirements

- The code is written in C.
- Compilation is done using the `gcc` compiler with specific options(`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`)
- Code follows the Betty style.
- You are not allowed to use system
- No errors or warnings during compilation.

4. Run the compiled program.

## Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. The goal is to complete the source code to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive, negative, or zero.

#### Instructions

- [Source Code](link_to_source_code)
- The variable `n` will store a different value every time you run this program.
- You don't have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not modify this code.
- The output of the program should be:
  - The number, followed by
  - If the number is greater than 0: is positive
  - If the number is 0: is zero
  - If the number is less than 0: is negative
  - Followed by a new line

#### Example

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-positive_or_negative.c -o 0-positive_or_negative
$ ./0-positive_or_negative
-520693284 is negative
$ ./0-positive_or_negative
561319348 is positive
$ ./0-positive_or_negative
0 is zero
```

Feel free to explore the code and use it to enhance your understanding of C programming.
